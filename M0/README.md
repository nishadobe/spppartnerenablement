## Exercise 1.1: Setup of Prerequisites
In this exercise, the goal is to install and configure everything that is needed to run through the exercises.

### Exercise 1.1.1 - Download and Install MAMP

MAMP is a free web server which we will use for this enablement.

Go to <a href="https://www.mamp.info/en/" target="_blank">https://www.mamp.info/en/</a> and install MAMP (Free Edition).

MAMP comes in 2 versions: Free and Pro. For this enablement we'll be using the Free version. 

**For Mac Users:** install MAMP with all default settings.

**For Windows Users:** during the installation of MAMP, you can also choose to install MAMP Pro. We will not be using MAMP Pro as part of this enablement so do not install MAMP Pro.

One you've started your web server, you can directly access the La Boutique website by going to <a href="http://localhost:8888/index.html" target="_blank">http://localhost:8888/index.html</a>


If the La Boutique website is displayed, then you've successfully completed this exercise.
