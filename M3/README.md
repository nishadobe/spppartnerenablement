# Module 3: Adobe Experience Platform Query Service

## Lab Overview

During this lab, you will get a hands-on preview of the Adobe Experience Platform Query Service, which is currently in Alpha testing and will soon be available to Proof of Concept customers.

The Query Service gives users the ability to query datasets in Adobe Experience Platform in support of many different use cases. It is a serverless tool which works on datasets from the solutions across the Experience Cloud and other data loaded into the Experience Platform. It supports SQL queries and connectivity from multiple client applications through its PostgreSQL compatibility. We will focus on datasets produced from Adobe Analytics and a few others.

## Key Takeaways

  * Become familiar with the Adobe Experience Platform UI
  * Connect to Query Service and run your SQL queries
  * Explore datasets in Adobe Experience Platform
  * Connect Power BI to the Adobe Experience Platform  

## Prerequisites

  * Some familiarity with SQL is preferred, but not required
  * Adobe Experience Platform (you will be provided a login)
  * Datasets (dataset used during lab, pre-loaded for you)
  * Configuration of PostgreSQL compliant client or command line interface (already installed on your lab machine)
  * Microsoft Power BI Desktop (also already installed)

## Lab Content

### [Exercise 0 - Before you start](exercises/0-before-we-start.md)

You will need a couple of things in order to successfully walk through the content of this lab.

### [Exercise 1 - Getting Started](exercises/1-getting-started.md)

In this exercise you will explore the Adobe Experience Platform Query Service User Interface, learn about data sets, find your queries and finaly setup a connection from PSQL.

### [Exercise 2 - Using the Query Service](exercises/2-using-query-service.md)

In this exercise you will learn about the basic Query Service syntax and you can identify the attributes of the XDM schema in your query.

### [Exercise 3 - Queries, queries, queries...  and churn analysis](exercises/3-queries.md)

In this exercise you will be doing queries, you will learn about the Adobe Defined Functions while doing some churn analysis. At the end of this exercise you will write a query to prepare a dataset for use in Microsoft Power BI.

### [Exercise 4 - Power BI](exercises/4-power-bi.md)

In this exercise you will generate a dataset from a query executed in the previous exercise and you will use this dataset in Power BI to to Callcenter Interaction Analysis.
