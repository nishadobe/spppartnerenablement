# Module 4: Adobe Experience Platform Data Science Workspace

## Lab Overview

You've seen the Luma website. When customers visit the website and click on a product, they are presented with personalized product recommendations.

This lab will enable you to create a simple Machine Learning model that generates product recommendations for this website using Data Science Workspace.

## Key Takeaways

* Become familiar with the Adobe Experience Platform UI
* Explore Adobe Experience Platform Data Science Workspace
* Analyze and transform your data.
* Author a model and operationalize it
* Train your model and experiment
* Score your model annd consume the insights

## Prerequisites

* Adobe Experience Platform (you will be provided a login)
* Datasets (dataset used during lab, pre-loaded for you)
* Zip-file containing the 3 required notebooks (on your computer's desktop)

## Lab Content

### [Exercise 0 - Before you start](./info.md)

You will need a couple of things in order to successfully walk through the content of this lab.

### [Exercise 1 - Data Exploration and Transformation](./ex1.md)

To create a machine learning model that will recommend products that users might like when they are looking at a particular product, you need to analyze previous purchases made by users on the website. In this lesson, you will explore purchase data flowing via Adobe Analytics to the Platform and transform that data into a Feature DataSet that can help train your machine learning model.

### [Exercise 2 - Model Authoring and Operationalization](./ex2.md)

In exercise 1 we created the Training Data required to power our Machine Learning model. In this lesson we will show you how you can use this data and author a machine learning model. In the real world, creating a dataset and a machine learning model will be an iterative process.

### [Exercise 3 - Model Training and Experimentation](./ex3.md)

So we’ve prepared our data, authored our model and packaged it to test it at scale as a recipe. Now let’s go ahead and train and test the model at scale.

### [Exercise 4 - Scoring and Consumption of Insights](./ex4.md)

Now that we’ve experimented with our recommendations model and have determined the optimal run, we can move on to scoring the model to generate product recommendations insights for customers of the Luma website.
