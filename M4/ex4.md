### Exercise 4.1 - Score a Model based on a Recipe

After training a model, we can use the model to score and as such, have the model build recommendations which can be activated through targeting.

To start scoring, let's re-open Training Run 1 by clicking it.

To score, you have to click the ```+ Score``` - button in the top right corner of your screen.

In the next step, you again have to select an Input Dataset. Let's choose the ```Recommendations Input Dataset```.

A ```Scoring Run``` is now created, and has a status of ```Pending```.

After 1-2 minutes, your Scoring Run's status will change to ```Running```.
